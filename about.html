            <p class="about-body">At Herculean House Athletics, we believe that fitness and wellbeing are the cornerstones of a full and vibrant life.
             Established in 2002, we began our journey as a family-owned business dedicated to providing exceptional
             gym equipment at affordable prices. But, we dreamed bigger than just being an ordinary fitness equipment
             supplier; we aspired to lead the industry.
             Two decades later, we are proud to have transformed Herculean House Athletics into one of America's premier online
             retailers of fitness equipment. We've moved beyond just supplying gear – we've become advocates for fitness,
             wellbeing and life enrichment.
            </p>
