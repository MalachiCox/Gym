                 The personal trainers are all accredited and take their clients’
                 fitness goals seriously. There is also the option of taking Group PT classes.

            <p class="review">I love the vibe of this gym it's the best vibe
                 I've had at any gym that I've been to. It is on the pricey side
                 but I find it worth it for me because I like the atmosphere so much.
                 Also I love the womens room it's usually quiet and not crowded
                 at all and no one stares at you so it's very nice. </p>
